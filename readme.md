This a weather app that I have done in the python web framework flask. The way that this works is you search for a location and it will make a call to a weather api and it will present you the data in the response using a HTML table format.

Skills Learned:-
- python
- flask routing
- calling api's in flask
- working with JSON in python
- templates
- rendering flask templates
- rest apis
